# CRUCIBLE: Honorable Souls

1v1 3D fighting game. Unity 6000.4.4f1 (URP), C#. Target input: PS4/PS5 controller (P2) and keyboard (P1).

## Layout

- `Assets/_project/Scripts/characters/` — `Fighter` (movement, dash, block, facing, hit reaction), `FighterStats`, `FighterData`.
- `Assets/_project/Scripts/combat/` — `CombatSystem` (attack phases, hitstun, hit resolution), `HitDetector` (trigger hitbox), `AttackData` (ScriptableObject per attack), `DamageCalculator`.
- `Assets/_project/Scripts/config/BalanceConfig.cs` — global tuning constants, `FRAME_TIME = 1/60`.
- `Assets/_project/Scripts/input/` — `InputManager` singleton on the `GameMangers` object.
- `Assets/_project/Scripts/UI/FightHud.cs`, `Assets/_project/Scripts/core/FightCamera.cs`.
- `Assets/_project/Characters/<Name>/Attacks/` — per-character `AttackData` assets, named `<Name>_<Weight>_<Move>`. `Characters/<Name>/Model/` — the Tripo rigged FBX + textures + material (git-ignored, see Git notes). `Characters/_Unrigged/` — Tripo meshes not rigged yet (git-ignored).
- `Assets/_project/Animation/Controllers/` — `P1_Bjorn.controller`, `P2_Miyamoto.controller`. `Animation/Clips/{Mixamo,Maria}/` — placeholder test clips; `Animation/Clips/Custom/` — for Blender exports.
- `Assets/_project/Data/Fighters/` — `FighterData` assets. `Assets/_project/Input/` — the Input System actions asset. `Assets/_project/Art/ConceptArt/` — character portraits.
- `Assets/_project/_Legacy/` — unreferenced leftovers (old Bjorn test model, Maria mesh/material, `Player2Controller.cs`, URP template readme). Safe to delete once nobody misses them.
- `Assets/_project/Scenes/testarena.unity` — the test scene.

## How combat works

- Each fighter root has `Fighter`, `CombatSystem`, `Animator`, `Rigidbody`, `CapsuleCollider`, and a child named `Hitbox` with `HitDetector` + a trigger `BoxCollider`.
- Attacks are frame data at 60fps: startup, active, recovery. `CombatSystem.Update` arms the hitbox when startup ends and disarms it when the active window ends. One hit per swing.
- `HitDetector.OnTriggerEnter` is the only damage path. It ignores trigger colliders and the owner, then calls `CombatSystem.OnHit`, which handles dash evasion, blocking, damage, hitstun and the hit animation.
- **Hitboxes are authored in world units.** The fighter roots are scaled in the scene (P1 4x, P2 3x) to size their models, and `HitDetector.Activate` divides that scale back out. Same units as `fighterRadius`, `dashDistance` and walk speed. The gizmo preview (select a fighter) shows the real box.
- `AttackData` also carries: `comesFrom` (which dash directions evade it), `hitSide` (Straight/Left/Right, picks the get-hit animation, set by hand, not detected), `hitstunFrames`.
- Hitstun: `CombatSystem.ApplyHitstun` blocks attacks, dashes and walking for the given frames. By default a hit also cancels the defender's attack in progress (`hitInterruptsAttack` on CombatSystem).

## Animator parameters the code uses

- `MoveSpeed` (float): walk blend, set every frame from input.
- `LightAttack`, `MediumAttack`, `HeavyAttack` (triggers): from each attack's `animatorTriggerName`.
- `HitSide` (int: 0 Straight, 1 Left, 2 Right) and `GetHit` (trigger): fired on hit. Until a controller defines both, `Fighter` only logs the side.

## Conventions

- Keep gameplay distances in world units; never rely on the model scale.
- New per-attack tuning goes on `AttackData` with a `[Tooltip]`; global numbers go in `BalanceConfig`.
- Debug logs are prefixed `P1:` / `P2:` and are on by default (`debugLogs` on each component).

## Compile check without opening Unity

Unity's bundled Roslyn can compile `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` (regenerate it from Unity if files were added). From Git Bash:

```
U="C:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.4.4f1/Editor"
"$U/Data/NetCoreRuntime/dotnet.exe" "$U/Data/DotNetSdkRoslyn/csc.dll" -nologo -target:library \
  -out:/tmp/Assembly-CSharp.dll @defs.rsp @refs.rsp @files.rsp
```

where the `.rsp` files are built from the csproj's `DefineConstants`, `HintPath` references and `Compile Include` entries.

## Git notes

- `Assets/_project/Characters/*/Model/` and `Characters/_Unrigged/` (Tripo FBX meshes, ~700 MB, ~1M verts each) are not committed; they need Git LFS (after decimation) or stay local. The scene references the Bjorn and Miyamoto FBX directly, so a fresh clone has no character models until those folders are copied in.
- `Assets/_Recovery/` holds Unity crash-recovery scenes. Do not commit.
- `.plastic/` is Plastic SCM state. Leave it out of git commits.

## Session log

The session log lives in `Sessions.md` (repo root) — this file was past its character limit.
**Append new session entries to the bottom of `Sessions.md`**, as `### YYYY-MM-DD — <title>`.
Durable facts belong up here instead; the log is for narrative and for the gotchas of a day.

## Where things stand (end of 2026-10-20)

- **Tasks 1–6 of `Design/Plan_LiteMobile.md` are done and play-verified**: six specials on
  `SP + Light/Medium/Heavy`, ten combo strings per character, four counter ripostes, defensive
  health recovery, per-fighter health/stamina/armour, a percentage HUD, a Moves screen, and a
  web build under half its old size (155 MB, one arena per build).
- **Task 7 (teaching the AI the lite game) was dropped by the user**, who is writing a new task
  list — the next session starts from that list, not from the lite plan's running order.
  `Design/Plan_2Weeks.md` is SUPERSEDED by `Plan_LiteMobile.md`.
- Attacks, combos, specials and ripostes are all authored data on `AttackData` + the editor
  menus that write them (`Crucible > Combat > Wire combo strings`,
  `Crucible > Animation > Wire special and riposte states`, `Use Mixamo packs`). Changing a
  move means editing the table in the editor script and re-running the menu item, not editing
  `.asset` YAML.
- Animation is the **Mixamo** packs (`Animation/Clips/Mixamo/{AxePack,AxePack2H,GreatSwordPack}`)
  until every system is finished; the mocap lane (`ArtSource/Mocap/`) and its clips stay in the
  repo, unused — the user's verdict on them was "wasn't the best for now".
- **Open, and only the user's phone can answer it**: frame rate, whether the on-screen buttons
  fall under a real thumb, online latency. Two touch-layout questions are written up in the lite
  plan and deliberately not changed blind.
- Known gaps carried forward: the AI cannot parry, throw a special or dial a string on purpose;
  the web build is uncompressed on purpose; hosting means the laptop is the server (relay +
  quick tunnel, new URL each restart); both fighters still share one `FighterData` called
  "test Fighter"; `parryCounterDamageMultiplier` is serialized 1.5 against `BalanceConfig`'s
  1.35 and `parryCounterWindow` 1.0 s against 0.5 s, never settled; `PlayProbe`, `BladeTrace`
  and `InputHold` are debug-only components still in the scene (`DebugTimeScale` is wanted —
  the Settings speed slider drives it).

## Testing the game from the CLI (hard-won, still true)

- **Set `Time.timeScale` directly, AFTER `GameMenu.StartMatch`.** `DebugTimeScale` only applies
  itself when the scale is ~1, and `GameMenu.ApplySettings` writes the Settings game speed
  (0.85) at match start, so the component is inert for the rest of the match and anything set
  on it beforehand is thrown away twice over.
- Play mode starts on the MAIN MENU, where every `Fighter` is disabled and
  `InputManager.InputEnabled` is false, so input-driven tests do nothing until
  `StartMatch` (public) runs. A direct `CombatSystem.TryAttack` still works there.
- The Editor runs ~4–17 fps under the CLI. A sub-second window (parry, lockout, a counter
  window) cannot be observed across a round trip: force the private timer by reflection and ask
  the gate in the SAME eval. `timeScale` 0.3 is right for dodge tests (0.08 lets one rendered
  frame advance ~6 game frames and whole startups pass unseen).
- Never recompile while the Editor is in play mode — the domain reload wipes
  `InputManager.Instance` while play continues, and every input override silently does nothing.
- `unity command recompile` and wait for `completed` before invoking an editor method you just
  edited, or the stale assembly runs. `Assets/_project/Editor/*.cs` are in the `Crucible.Editor`
  asmdef, which the Roslyn check's `.rsp` files do not cover.
- Place test fighters through `Rigidbody.position` + `transform.position` +
  `Physics.SyncTransforms()`, keep each fighter's OWN y (averaging them is what left both
  floating in a saved scene), and wait a couple of frames before `TryAttack`.
- `eval_file` reports a bad member reference as "Unreachable code detected"; it rejects a
  top-level `using` and trips on ambiguous `Object`. An eval that throws returns no result line
  at all — re-run it without the `grep` to see the exception.
